        So if you got here because you scanned the Monoprice Mini V2 3d-printer
        and you want to know how to use it, you are in the right place!
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Stuff you might need to make things</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A place to get the Things { Thingiverse }</li>
        <li>A tool to convert the Things to Gcode { CURA }</li>
        <li>Something to transfer the Thing to the Printer { SD Card }</li>
        <li>Maybe a tool to make your own things! { Fusion360 }</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Setting Up Cura</h2>
    <p>
        Even though you have all the tools there is a little bit more work we
        have to do before you start making your first print.
    </p>

        I'll finish this after lab but I am going to leave the sticker on it rn
        feel free to still print!
